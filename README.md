# `node-hid-relay`

A Node.JS library which can control a USB relay device using the HID interface.

## Supported Devices

- DCTTech.com USB Relay Modules (2,4,6, or 8 relays)

In theory these are supported, but untested as I don't have them:

- Ucreatefun USB Modules
- Shenzhen LC serial USB relays
